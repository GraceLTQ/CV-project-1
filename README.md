# CV-project-1
## Brief
CS 4670/5670: Computer VIsion, Spring 2024
Project 1: Stereo
Assigned: Friday, March 8th, 2024
Due: Tuesday, March 19th, 2024 at 10 pm (turn in via CMSX)
Teams: This assignment should be done in a group of 2 students.

## Synopsis
This assignment is meant to exercise concepts of stereo and photometric stereo. There are two parts to this assignment, please complete the TODOs in the following files.
- stereo.py
- photometric_stereo.py

## Getting Started
### Python Packages
Please use python3 for this assignment. We recommend creating a virtual environment and installing all the necessary packages to limit issues with setup.
Make sure you have the following python packages installed:
          numpy, matplotlib, Pillow, scipy
          
### Dataset
The link to the datasets is here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14U12oqvS6SwRQuaBpMQVO8FHcYOfSf KU/view
Please download and unzip manually into the data folder.

## Part 1 - Stereo:
For this part of the assignment there are 3 functions to complete: get_ncc_descriptors, compute_ncc_vol, and get_disparity. Please refer to stereo.py for instructions.

## Part 2 - Photometric Stereo:
For this part of the assignment there is 1 function to complete: photometric_stereo. Please refer to photometric_stereo.py for instructions.

## Demo:
There are two demo notebooks that you can use to test your implementation of stereo and photometric stereo. These are called stereo_demo.ipynb and photometric_stereo_demo.ipynb respectively.
We have also provided a version of our notebooks as html files which can be used to compare your implementation with ours. The html notebooks are called stereo_demo.html and photometric_stereo_demo.html.

## Turn in:
To recap, you must submit:
- stereo.py
- photometric_stereo.py

## done
